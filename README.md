# Whatsapp Chat Analyzer

I've created an app on Heroku to understand the analysis of any whatsapp chat (whether it is two person chat or group chat).

This is a basic app where you can upload your chat history and get the complete analysis of chat history group level (overall) as well as individual level.

**Libraries Used:**

    streamlit
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    pandas
    emojis
    re
    collections
    emojis
    urlextract
    wordcloud

This app is particularly created in python 3.7 version environment as wordcloud is not supported by newer python versions.

If you've any questions related to Heroku deployment, you can check the Heroku documentation page.
